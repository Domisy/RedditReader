Here is the new repo for our project, RedditReader (name subject to change).

Starting off with just a playbook version, but once it's finished it should be relatively simple to port to android.

Features Include:
- Displays main Reddit feeds, including 'new', 'top' etc.
- Browse through comments.
- Allows browsing of subreddits.
- Search reddit.
- Login with your account, which will open up the ability to comment and rate posts.
More obviously to come...

TODO:
- We need a 90x90 icon for the app.
- Need a 'back' button and a 'refresh' button, as well as a 'profile' button. Would be great if someone could hand make these, rather than me just downloading a pic online.
- SPLASHSCREEN image. Will post specs later, but we need an image to use for startup of the app.
