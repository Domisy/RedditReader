Here is the new repo for our project, Reddit in Motion.

Starting off with just a playbook version, but once it's finished it should be relatively simple to port to android.

Features Include:
- Displays main Reddit feeds, including 'new', 'top' etc.
- Browse through comments.
- Allows browsing of subreddits.
- Search reddit.
- Login with your account
- Upvote and Downvote posts
- Subreddits change to reflect user's favorites


TODO:
- Add comment support
- Enhance webview experience
